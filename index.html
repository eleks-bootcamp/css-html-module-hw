    <h3>About me</h3>

    <p>I have been working as a Business Analyst since 2018. 
    My first experience was the work on the ProzorroSale project for 1.5 years as a part of the development of functionality for online auctions, real property auctions in particular. 
    In December 2019 I joined Eleks, where I took up several different projects. 
    One of them was Jira support, in particular the development of new Issue Types for projects (among these: Sabbatical leave, Domestic relocation, Organization structure management (described and partially developed Jira functionality for the organization change process), and constant improvement of the existing operations). 
    Starting from May 2020 I occupied the Business Analyst role on the TeamPro Decommission project until its completion and also worked on some following improvements until June 2021. 
    After that, I focused on the task description for changes in Jira and the implementation of some of them. 
    </p>

    <p>By working on different projects, I had the chance to collaborate with different kinds of stakeholders and clients. 
    This experience taught me to find common language with various types of characters, and also helped me to get used to constant changes in team composition. 
    I see the ability to work under stress and pressure as my most important personal skill. 
    Most of all, I enjoy working on setting up processes from scratch and implementing changes to fine-tune these processes.
